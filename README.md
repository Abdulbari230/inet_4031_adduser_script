## Assignment 9: Part 2 - Automating User Creation

### Overview
Many operations done to a server, especially when a large number of servers must be administered, are automated. They can be automated using various tools. BASH shell scripts are a common way to script repetitive operations. PERL and Python are also used for command line automation. In this assignment, you will be using Python.

### Steps
1. Create a new GitHub repository for storing code.
2. Create the `create-users.py` script.
3. Create the `create-users.input` file.
4. Create users with the `create-users.py` script.
5. Confirm the users have been created.
6. Sync your code with your GitHub repository.
7. Create a professional looking README that explains the operation of the code and how a user can run the code.
